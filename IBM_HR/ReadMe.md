# Project 3 - IBM Human Resources Attrition Model

Project 3 involved using partitioning algorithms and supervised learning to create a binary or multiclass classification model.

I used the [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) dataset from Kaggle, and utilized K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, Random Forests, and other modeling techniques to make business recommendations to offset attrition costs.
