# Project 1 - MTA Turnstile Analysis

Project 1 required us to pull turnstile information from New York City's MTA Data.  After cleaning the data, we were tasked with making recommendations to a fictional non-profit seeking optimal placement of canvassers for an upcoming gala.

Using various EDA techniques, PyPlot, GeoPy, and Folium, we recommended and mapped four stations based on ridership and proximity to tech companies.
